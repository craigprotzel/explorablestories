### Project #1
**Due Wednesday 01/10**  
Working individually or with a partner, create a web experience that tells a “site-specific story” on a topic of your choice. The experience should be constructed around a specific location in Shanghai, include at least 2-3 pages of written material (approx. 1000 - 1200 words), and incorporate some basic forms of interactivity (i.e. “click events”). Code examples will be provided to help with some of the technical aspects. You must also include some multimedia (i.e. sound, video, images, gifs, etc) to augment the storytelling experience. The project should also include an ‘About’ page (200-400 words) that provides a brief description of the project, the overall goals of the site, the design approach, the technical aspects, any major challenges or insights, and possible next steps. Be prepared to present and share your project with the class.   

### Project #2
**Due Friday 01/19**  
Working independently, utilize p5JS or an “experiential” javascript library of your choosing to create an “explorable story” that includes 3-4 pages of written material (1200-1400 words) plus some additional multi-media (i.e. sound, video, images, gifs, etc). You may continue with the story from your first project or create an entirely new one. The explorable should allow for some form of “active” media consumption. Your project should live on the web and be designed in a way that is accessible to a general audience. The project should also include an ‘About’ page (200-400 words) that provides a brief description of the project, the overall goals of the site, the design approach, the technical aspects, any major challenges or insights, and possible next steps. Be prepared to present and share your project with the class.
