Explorable Stories Projects
===========================

### Project #1
**Due Monday 01/09**  
Working individually or with a partner, create a web experience that tells a “site-specific story” on a topic of your choice. The experience should:
* Incude at least 2-3 pages of written material
* Utilize some form(s) of "multi-media" such as sound, images, or video
* Incorporate some basic form(s) of interactivity such as “click events”.
* Be constructed around or directly related to a specific location in London.   
Feel free to use “Let’s Take A Walk” as both model and inspiration. Code examples will be provided to help with some of the technical aspects. Be prepared to present and share your project with the class.  

The grading rubric for this first assignment is the following:
* 10: Markup/Code Quality - Legibility, management, clarity, comments
* 10: Technical Implementation - Demonstrate an understanding of the material, specifically the use of HTML, CSS and javascript
* 10: Design - Does the site make sense, is it well designed, is there a good user experience, is it well presented?
* 10: Storytelling - Does the website tell a "story"?  
* 10: Creativity - Demonstration of personal expression   

### Project #2
**Due Friday 01/13**  
Utilizing an “experiential” javascript library of your choice, create an explorable web prototype that tells a story. You may build upon your “story” from Project #1 or create an entirely new one. Your page should have 2-3 pages of written material and incorporate at least one javascript library. Be prepared to present and share your project with the class.

The grading rubric for the second assignment is the following:
* 10: Markup/Code Quality - Legibility, management, clarity, comments
* 10: Technical Implementation - Demonstrate an understanding of the material, specifically the use of HTML, CSS, javascript, and a javascript library
* 10: Design - Does the site make sense? Is there an interaction that contributes to the overall experience?
* 10: Storytelling - Does the website tell a "story" or is does it have potential for a story?  
* 10: Creativity - Are you pushing yourself creatively? 


### Final Project
**Due Thursday 01/19**  
Create an “explorable story” that includes 4-5 pages of written material along with some additional multi-media. You may continue with the story from your previous project(s) or create a new one. The explorable should allow for some form of “active” media consumption. Your project should live on the web and be designed in a way that is accessible to a general audience.

The grading rubric for the second assignment is the following:
* 10: Markup/Code Quality - Legibility, management, clarity, comments
* 10: Technical Implementation - Demonstrate an understanding of the material, specifically the use of HTML, CSS, javascript, and a javascript library
* 10: Design - Is there a cohesive and well thought out experience?
* 10: Storytelling - Does the website tell a "story"? 
* 10: Creativity - Are you pushing yourself creatively?
