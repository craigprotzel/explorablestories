###Course Description
The fundamental building blocks of good storytelling have remained consistent throughout history. What constantly changes though are the technologies, including tools, mediums and platforms, through which stories are communicated. In this class, we will utilize one of today's dominant platforms for communication, the world wide web, to create and share stories that are engaging, interactive, and “explorable”.   

But what does it mean for a story to be “explorable”? In terms of the modern web, does allowing a user to click and swipe make something “explorable”? Does that mean it is interactive? Is there a difference? This course will embrace the principles of constructivist learning theory to help answer these questions. Coupling an active learning approach with a foundation in network systems thinking, we will challenge ourselves to produce stories that empower users to become active media consumers. Can we design opportunities for inquiry, creativity, and discovery?  Fortunately, current web browsers offer an open computational playground where we can generate, share, and test these very ideas.   

Combining traditional writing skills with modern web javascript libraries and other multi-media tools, students will ultimately learn how to write, design, and code their own 21st century explorable stories. These stories may take a variety of forms including creative fiction, journalistic non-fiction, educational lessons, or personalized accounts. The work will be inspired and influenced by our time in London, but will address a global audience. The goal will be for each student to iteratively produce their own compelling explorable story that lives on the web and can be shared universally. Some web development or coding experience is preferable but not required.  

###Learning Outcomes
* Understand and produce stories that empower users to become active media consumers  
* Develop an understanding of constructionist (active) learning theory and networked systems thinking along with their relationship to the world wide web    
* Think critically about current and future web-based content, interactions, and experiences
* Identify and generate engaging stories written, designed, and translated for the world wide web  
* Gain an understanding of client-side web technologies, specifically HTML, CSS, and javascript  
* Gain exposure to a variety of modern web javascript libraries that facilitate the development of interactive explorable experiences  
* Gain experience with prototyping, iterative design, and user testing for the web  

###Teaching Methodology
This course, embracing an active learning approach, will be both seminar and studio. In the seminar portions of the class, time will be spent engaging in short lectures and critical discussions, reviewing readings, sharing assignment work, and meeting with special guests. In the studio portions, students will participate in hands-on creative and technical activities, engage in practice-based workshops, generate and evaluate project ideas, and research case-specific topics. Throughout the class, students will be encouraged to learn through play, experimentation, collaboration, and (of course) exploration.  

###Course Mission: L.E.G.S.
* Learn - skills, tools, processes, techniques, resources
* Explore - challenges, risks, failures, adventures, dreams 
* Grow - advance, empower, progress, reflect, repeat
* Share - describe, document, communicate, contribute, participate

###Homework Assignments
In addition to the assigned readings, we will be exploring and engaging in hands-on exercises. You will be expected to utilize a web blog* to document your work, describe your experiences, and draw connections to course readings, presentations, and discussions. Your posts should include at least a half page to a page of original writing (approx. 200 - 400 words) plus any other requested media assets such as photos, sound, video, code etc.
*Each student will be given their own dedicated web space at the beginning of the class.

###Project #1
**Due Monday 01/09**  
Working with a partner, create a web experience that tells a “site-specific story” on a topic of your choice. The experience should be an auditory one that  leverages at least 2-3 pages of written material, incorporates some basic form of interactivity (i.e. “click events”), and is constructed around a specific location in London. Use “Let’s Take A Walk” as both model and inspiration. Code examples will be provided to help with some of the technical aspects. Be prepared to present and share your project with the class. 

###Project #2
**Due Friday 01/13**  
Utilizing an “experiential” javascript library of your choice, create an explorable web prototype that tells a story. You may build upon your “story” from Project #1 or create an entirely new one. Your page should have 2-3 pages of written material and incorporate at least one javascript library. Be prepared to present and share your project with the class.

###Final Project
**Due Thursday 01/19**  
Create an “explorable story” that includes 4-5 pages of written material along with some additional multi-media. You may continue with the story from your previous project(s) or create a new one. The explorable should allow for some form of “active” media consumption. Your project should live on the web and be designed in a way that is accessible to a general audience.

###Class Trips
We will take several trips around London to gain inspiration and insight into the world of interactive explorable media. Places we plan to visit include the following:  
* Science Museum, London (01/05)
* V&A Museum (01/05)  
* The Barbican Centre (01/06)  
* Gielgud Theatre (01/09)  
* JWT London Ad Agency  with NYUAD Alum Jamie Sutherland (01/11)
* The New Tate Modern (01/12)  
* Technology Will Save Us + Hirsch & Mann with NYU Alum Daniel Hirschmann (01/17)  

###Class Guests
Paul May, Creative Technologist, Instructor RCA, formerly Sloan-Kettering Innovation Lab, NYU ITP Masters Alumni (01/09)  
Dirichi D’Ike-njoku, NYUAD Alumni, Web App Developer (01/13)

###Attendance & Participation
* Students are expected to attend ALL classes and actively engage in ALL discussions, exercises, and activities.   
* Sustained in class participation that demonstrates careful reading and reviewing of all materials is a requirement for succeeding in this course. Participating in class is helpful for me to get to know you as an individual and to keep track of your progress. It also provides you and your classmates greater opportunities to learn from each other.  
* Be on time - for class, for assignments, for meetings. Habitual lateness will not be tolerated.   
* Unexcused absences or habitual lateness will negatively impact your final grade for the class. If you know you are going to be late or absent, please email me in advance. If you have an emergency, please let me know as soon as you can. Please note that more than two unexcused absences (more than 20 minutes late to class) will result in a lower final grade (i.e. B+ to B). More than five unexcused absences will result in an F.  
* All assignments must be turned in on time. For each day an assignment is late, it will result in a lower final grade (i.e. B+ to B).   
* Be prepared to work in groups on some of the assignments.  
* You are expected to present your work in class  Explaining your work to other people is a great way to better understand the material and answer questions for yourself.  
* Ask questions. If you do not ask questions, I can only assume you understand the material completely.  
* Communicate with me and let me know if you have any concerns pertaining to the course. If you would like extra help or additional instruction, please let me know. You can email me, sign up for office hours, speak with me before or after class, or all of the above.  

###Laptops
Laptop use will be expected in class, but should be focused on class-specific material, applications, and research. Whenever classmates are presenting please keep your laptop closed. The quality of the class depends in large part on your attention and active participation, so please respect your fellow classmates and close your lid.  

###Mobile Phones
 Please put them on vibrate or turn them off before you come to class. If you have an emergency that requires you to answer your phone during class, please let me know me ahead of time or quietly step out of class to take the call.
